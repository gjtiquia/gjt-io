# gjt-io

used as a url shortener / redirect service 

redirects on the client-side because its cheaper than running my own backend

`gjt.io` is also used as a short domain for side projects of `gjtiquia.com`

cuz `ijustwannacopypaste.gjtiquia.com` is way too long compared to `ijustwannacopypaste.gjt.io`

and also its cheaper to buy one short domain than buy a domain for each of the 99+ unfinished side projects that i have lol
